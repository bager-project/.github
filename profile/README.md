# B.A.G.E.R.
B.A.G.E.R. (Basic Autonomous Ground Excavation Robot) is an autonomous excavator robot featuring a full project documentation parser.
Parser is written in Python, while B.A.G.E.R.'s movement is controlled using Raspberry Pi Pico programmed with C and C++.
We are keen to keep human operators to oversee computer's work.

## Features
- metal construction coated with anti-corrosion paint
- hydraulic system
- Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller
- [B.A.G.E.R. parser](https://github.com/bager-project/bager-parser) - full project documentation parser
- software licensed under PolyForm Shield 1.0.0 license
