# B.A.G.E.R.
B.A.G.E.R. (Basic Autonomous Ground Excavation Robot) is an autonomous excavator robot featuring a full project documentation parser.
Parser is written in Python, while B.A.G.E.R.'s movement is controlled using Raspberry Pi Pico programmed with C and C++.
We are keen to keep human operators to oversee computer's work.
